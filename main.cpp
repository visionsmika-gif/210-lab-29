/* INSTRUCTIONS:

The pseudocode will be coded using VS Code connected to a GitHub repository.

Pseudocode is plain-language comments, placed in your code as actual comments, that serve as a coding framework.
What are the major steps and blocks of code necessary for the project? What functions? Put placeholders for all
those with pseudocode comments.

Write a mockup, which is a bare-bones wireframe of your code. It should have dummy variables and do trivial
outputs to demonstrate that the functions work, are passing data, and that the data structure is coded properly
with one data element. */
