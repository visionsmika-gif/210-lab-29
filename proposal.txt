INSTRUCTIONS:
Imagine the subject and details of your project, and write a proposal. Write this proposal in your GitHub repository in a file named proposal.txt.
The proposal should describe the project and explain its implementation. Explain how the simulation will take place, and what it will show.
Explain the time periods you've chosen.

REQUIREMENTS:
It needs to be a simulation.
The simulation can be anything in life or nature.
The simulation needs to be a discrete-event simulation (time-based).
The simulation must feature an std::map.
The simulation must retrieve data from an external file.
The value in the map's key-value pair must be a 3-element std::array of std::lists. This makes a nested data structure, with the outer map hosting an inner array of three lists.
There must be at least 100 lines of data processed by the program. LLM's are well-known for helping to generate data like this.
The driver program should neatly display the std::map data.
The driver should show the initial state of the environment, and how it changes after a certain number of time periods. Use at least 25 time periods.
The program must have at least one function.
