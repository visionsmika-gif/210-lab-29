DESCRIPTION:
My project will be a simulation of clothing stores. The purpose is to simulate daily changes to the stock of several different clothing stores.

IMPLEMENTATION:
An std::map will store each clothing store. The map's key will be the name of the clothing store. A single value in the map is an array of three lists.
The three lists represent different categories of clothing that the store sells: tops, bottoms, and shoes.

For example, one map entry is Bubbly Boutique. The key for this map entry is the name "Bubbly Boutique." Bubbly Boutique has three categories
of clothing: tops, bottoms, and shoes. There can be other map entries for other stores as well, such as "Casual Couture" and "Aesthetic Apparel."
Both "Casual Couture" and "Aesthetic Apparel" sell their own tops, bottoms, and shoes.

Before the simulation begins, several clothing pieces will be read from a file and organized into three different vectors for tops, bottoms, and shoes.
The stores will be initialized with some random number of tops, bottoms, and shoes taken from these vectors.

The simulation will show each day of a 25-day time period. Each day, these three events have a chance of happening:
1 - A store restocks with new clothing. (New items are added to a store's tops, bottoms, or shoes.)
2 - A store sells some of its clothing. (Items are removed from a store's tops, bottoms, or shoes.)
3 - A store transfers some of its clothing to another store to be sold there instead. (Items are removed from one store and added to another.)

When one of these events happen, an output will be displayed (e.g. RESTOCK EVENT: "3 tops were added to [Clothing Store Name]".
At the end of one day, each store's stock will be displayed to show the result of all the events of that day.
