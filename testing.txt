I can unit test the following functions:
* populateClothingPool
* addClothes
* restockClothing
* displayStock
* sellClothing
* transferClothing

First I will separate the functions into a header file and include the header file in the unit test program.

For populateClothingPool(), I will read from the file clothing.txt() and ensure that the clothing pool contains the expected clothing
in each of its categories (i.e. Tops are only put into the 'Top' category, Bottoms are only put into the 'Bottoms' category, and so on).

For addClothes(), I will try filling a store with a small number of items. Then, I will check that the stores contain those items,
meaning that the clothes were successfully added.

For restockClothing(), I will call the function on a store and check that the stock increased by the correct number in the correct category.

For sellClothing(), I will call the function on a store and check that the stock decreased by the correct number in the correct category.

For transferClothing(), I will call the function on a store and have it transfer clothing to another store. I will check that the store correctly
lost one item from the correct category, while the other store correctly gained that same item in the same category.

I will use displayStock() between each of the above functions to ensure that they executed correctly, as well as to ensure that the stock is
displayed correctly.
