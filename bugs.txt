1) In the sellClothing() function, when attempting to generate a random index for a clothing category, I called generateRandomNum() with arguments 0, 3.
I had meant to call generateRandomNum() with argument 0, 2, to randomly generate either 0, 1, or 2. This caused the out of bounds access whenever
an index of 3 was generated (which was too large). I fixed this issue by changing the arguments to 0 and 2.

2) Sometimes, transferClothing() would have a store transfer to itself. I fixed this by adding a comparison between this store's name and the other store's
name. A loop will continue to choose a new store as long those names are equal, ensuring that a store chooses a different store to transfer to, and not itself.

3) In the transferClothing() function, I accidentally declared auto otherStoreIt twice---once before the loop and another time inside the loop. This hid
the actual otherStoreIt that I wanted to advance inside of the loop, causing the loop to go on and on, and causing the daily time intervals to stop early.
To fix this I had to remove the 'auto' keyword inside the loop to not accidentally declare otherStoreIt a second time.

4) In populateClothingPool(), I unintentionally pushed clothing that was meant to be in the "Shoes" category to "Tops" instead. This was because I copy and pasted
the branch used for adding "Tops" and reused it for adding "Shoes," forgetting to change the index from 'TOPS' to 'SHOES.' To fix this, I simply changed the index
to 'SHOES' to add the clothes to the proper list.

5) In the main function, when generating a 'probability' variable, I accidentally generated a random number between 1-60, and not between 1-100. This meant that
when I checked if probability <= 60, the condition was always true, and the event would always happen, when there was only meant to be a 60% chance that it would
happen. I fixed this by changing the RNG from 1-60 to 1-100.

6) In sellClothing(), the function would generate a random number of clothing to sell, but sometimes that number would be more than the number of clothing
that the store had in the chosen category. I fixed this by making the function continuously generate a new number until it was less than or equal to the store's
amount of clothing in that category.

7) There was a minor output bug in displayStock() where I printed the newline in the wrong section of the loop. I meant to print it between each clothing store,
but instead I printed it after each clothing category. I fixed this by printing a newline in the outer loop instead.

8) In displayStock(), I originally printed each category name by accessing the first element of that list using .front(), and then accessing that Clothing element's
"category" attribute. However, this meant that .front() would sometimes be called on an empty list whenever there were no pieces of clothing in that category
(i.e. if it were out of stock). So, I had to change the implementation to use a for-loop (instead of a range-based for loop), so that I could have an index i.
Then, I could access the name of the current category using the categoryNames array and the index i.

9) There was a small error where the time intervals started at Day 0 and went up to Day 24, when it was supposed to start at Day 1 and go up to Day 25. I simply
changed the time-interval loop so that it started at i = 0 and iterated until it was less than or equal to NUM_DAYS.

10) Sometimes nothing would happen at a store after a time interval, but "Nothing happened" would fail to print. This would occur when sellClothing() or
transferClothing() was called, but the function returned before anything was sold/transferred because the store didn't have any clothing to sell or transfer.
So, I changed these functions to return a bool. They would return false if the stores were empty and they sold/transferred nothing.
